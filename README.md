# Bits Off #

Bits Off is a game that I am bringing to the web as a personal project and a way to get into the web game development.

Bits Off is a name that was chosen because my game is an adaptation of [Lights Out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_%28game%29) and because I'm a Computer Scientist/Mathematician. 
And you know... Bits... Lights... On... Off... One... Zero...

P.S.:
Sorry for bad english... English *is not* my first language.
